# Networking Fundamentals

## OSI Model
The OSI Model has 7 layers, each with a role in how data travels across a network.

**1. Physical** – bits on wires, radio waves, cables.  
**2. Data Link** – frames, MAC addresses, switches.  
**3. Network** – packets, IP addresses, routers.  
**4. Transport** – TCP/UDP, ports, three-way handshake.  
**5. Session** – manages sessions (e.g., keeping a web session alive).  
**6. Presentation** – encryption, compression, data formats.  
**7. Application** – user-level protocols (HTTP, DNS, SMTP).

## IP Addressing
- **IPv4:** 32-bit addresses, written in 4 octets (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
- **IPv6:** 128-bit addresses, massive space (~340 undecillion possible addresses).  
- **Public vs Private:**  
  - Private IPv4 ranges:  
    - `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`  
    - `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`  
    - `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`  
- `8.8.8.8` = Google’s public DNS server (real, not just an example).  
- IPs are split into **octets** (8 bits each). IPv4 has 4 octets.

## LAN Topologies
- **Star:** devices connect to a central hub/switch. Most reliable, but more expensive.  
- **Bus:** all devices share a single backbone cable. Cheap, but one failure can kill the network.  
- **Ring:** devices connected in a circle. Data travels one way. Rare now, but foundational.

## Packets vs Frames
- **Packet (Layer 3 – Network):** contains source and destination IP addresses.  
- **Frame (Layer 2 – Data Link):** wraps packets; contains source/destination MAC addresses + error check.  
- Packets live **inside** frames.  
- Analogy:  
  - Packet = “deliver to 8.8.8.8”  
  - Frame = “hand it to MAC address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff inside this LAN”  

---

## Encapsulation
- Data is wrapped in headers at each layer (like Russian dolls or envelopes).  
- Flow: Application Data → Transport Segment (TCP/UDP) → Network Packet (IP) → Data Link Frame (MAC) → Physical (bits).  

---

## Switches vs Routers
- **Switch (Layer 2):**  
  - Works with MAC addresses.  
  - Moves frames inside a LAN.  

- **Router (Layer 3):**  
  - Works with IP addresses.  
  - Moves packets between networks (LAN ↔ WAN).  

---

## MAC vs IP
- **MAC Address (Layer 2):**  
  - Hardware address (burned into NIC).  
  - Local only, like an apartment number.  

- **IP Address (Layer 3):**  
  - Logical, assigned, can change.  
  - Global, like a street address.

## Upcoming Topics
- DNS (translating names to IPs).  
- Internet Backbone.  
- Firewalls (Layers 3 & 4).  
- Linux basics once I spin up my VM.
