Networking Fundamentals
OSI Model

Layer 1 – Physical: Cables, Wi-Fi signals. Moves raw bits (0s and 1s).

Layer 2 – Data Link: Frames, MAC addresses. Checks for errors.

Layer 3 – Network: IP addresses, routing. Moves packets between networks.

Layer 4 – Transport: TCP/UDP, ports, reliable delivery (TCP handshake).

Layer 5 – Session: Starts/ends sessions between devices.

Layer 6 – Presentation: Encryption, compression, translation.

Layer 7 – Application: User-facing apps (web browser, email, etc).

Packets vs Frames

Frames (Layer 2): Contain MAC addresses. Used inside a local network (LAN).

Packets (Layer 3): Contain IP addresses. Used to move data across networks.

Encapsulation = Data is wrapped layer by layer (packet goes inside a frame).

Encapsulation

Each OSI layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer).

Example: Application data → TCP segment → IP packet → Ethernet frame.

At the other end, headers are stripped off (decapsulation).

MAC vs IP

MAC address (Layer 2): Permanent hardware ID, unique to each device.

IP address (Layer 3): Logical address, can change (DHCP).

Analogy: MAC = your fingerprint, IP = your postal address.

Routers vs Switches

Switch (Layer 2): Uses MAC addresses. Forwards data inside a LAN.

Router (Layer 3): Uses IP addresses. Connects different networks (LAN to WAN).

Together: Switches handle local traffic, routers move traffic between networks.

Three-Way Handshake (TCP)

Client sends SYN.

Server replies with SYN-ACK.

Client responds with ACK.

After this, a reliable TCP connection is established.

LAN Topologies

Star: Central hub/switch. Reliable, but costly.

Bus: All devices share one cable. Cheap, but collisions.

Ring: Data moves in a loop. Rare today.

IP Addressing

IPv4: 32-bit, written as 4 octets (e.g. 192.168.1.1).

IPv6: 128-bit, written in hex, almost unlimited addresses.

8 bits = 1 octet.

Example: 192.168.1.1 → each number (192, 168, 1, 1) is one octet.

Internet Backbone

The “core highways” of the internet.

Massive, high-speed fiber optic cables that connect continents.

Owned by big ISPs and telecom companies.

Your ISP connects you into this backbone → that’s how your traffic reaches anywhere worldwide.
