# Networking Fundamentals

## OSI Model
The OSI Model has 7 layers, each handling part of how data moves across a network:

**1. Physical (Layer 1)** – the actual hardware: wires, fiber, Wi-Fi signals. Deals with raw bits (1s and 0s).  
**2. Data Link (Layer 2)** – works with **frames**. Uses **MAC addresses**. Responsible for error detection at the frame level. Devices: **Switches**.  
**3. Network (Layer 3)** – works with **packets**. Uses **IP addresses**. Decides routing and addressing. Devices: **Routers, Firewalls**.  
**4. Transport (Layer 4)** – end-to-end communication using **TCP/UDP**. Handles reliability (TCP three-way handshake, sequencing, retransmissions). Also where **ports** live.  
**5. Session (Layer 5)** – keeps sessions open between devices (like logging into a website and staying connected).  
**6. Presentation (Layer 6)** – formatting, encryption, compression (e.g., SSL/TLS, JPEG, UTF-8).  
**7. Application (Layer 7)** – what the user interacts with (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP, etc.).

## Encapsulation
- Data is wrapped as it travels down the OSI layers.  
- Application data → Segments (Transport) → Packets (Network) → Frames (Data Link) → Bits (Physical).  
- Each layer adds its own **header** (and sometimes trailer).  
- At the receiving end, the process is reversed (de-encapsulation).  

---

## Packets vs Frames
- **Packet (Layer 3):** Contains source + destination **IP address**. Travels across networks.  
- **Frame (Layer 2):** Contains source + destination **MAC address**. Travels within a local network (LAN).  
- Analogy: Think of a **packet** as a letter (with addresses) inside an **envelope (frame)** that gets delivered.

## IP Addressing
- **IPv4:** 32-bit addresses split into **4 octets** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
- **IPv6:** 128-bit addresses. Huge space (~340 undecillion addresses). Created to fix IPv4 exhaustion.  

**Public vs Private IPv4 Ranges:**  
- `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`  
- `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`  
- `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`  

**Special IPs:**  
- `127.0.0.1` – loopback (your own machine).  
- `8.8.8.8` – Google’s public DNS server (real, not just an example).

## MAC vs IP Addresses
- **MAC (Media Access Control):**  
  - Hard-coded into network cards (unique per device).  
  - Layer 2 (Data Link).  
  - Used for local delivery inside a LAN.  

- **IP Address:**  
  - Logical address, can change (static or dynamic).  
  - Layer 3 (Network).  
  - Used for delivery across networks.  

Together:  
- A switch uses **MAC addresses** to deliver frames.  
- A router uses **IP addresses** to deliver packets.

## LAN Topologies
- **Star:** All devices connect to a central hub/switch. Most reliable, but expensive.  
- **Bus:** Single backbone cable shared by all devices. Cheap, but failure-prone.  
- **Ring:** Devices connected in a circle, data travels one way. Legacy but important historically.  

---

## Routers vs Switches
- **Switch (Layer 2):** Uses MAC addresses. Forwards frames within a LAN.  
- **Router (Layer 3):** Uses IP addresses. Forwards packets between networks (LAN ↔ WAN).  
- **Firewall:** Typically lives at Layer 3/4, filtering packets based on IP/port/protocol.

## TCP Three-Way Handshake
Used to establish a reliable TCP connection:  
1. **SYN** – client asks to start a connection.  
2. **SYN-ACK** – server acknowledges and responds.  
3. **ACK** – client confirms. Connection established.  

---

## Internet Backbone
- The **Internet Backbone** is made up of high-capacity fiber connections between major ISPs and data centers.  
- Managed by Tier 1 providers (e.g., AT&T, Level 3, NTT).  
- Without it, global data transfer would break down.  
- Local ISPs connect to the backbone to provide access to homes and businesses.
